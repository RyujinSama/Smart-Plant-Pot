# Smart-Plant-Pot
A innovative project to ease human work to water the plant pot they have in their household . Taking care of plants can be largely time consuming. Another big problem is to put the plant pot at a place here it get a maximum sunlight. And it is very tiring to shift the plant, time to time to those places. Watering the plant by checking the amount of moisture in the soil of the pot is another very important and time consuming task. Automatic all this process can result in a huge work reduction and time saving, make sure that the plant stays alive and healthy. With an ESP 32 at its core this project uses a water level sensor to let you know when to refill the concealed tank and a soil moisture sensor to figure out when to water your plant based on its needs
